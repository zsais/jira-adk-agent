# Project Proposal: The Jira Agent

## 1. Introduction & Purpose

Engineers spend a significant amount of time on administrative and repetitive tasks within Jira, which detracts from their core development work. To address this inefficiency, we propose the development of the **Jira Agent**, an AI-powered assistant designed to automate these manual Jira operations and streamline engineering workflows.

The primary goal is to significantly reduce the time engineers and other team members spend on manual Jira administration, leading to faster development cycles and improved overall efficiency.

## 2. Proposed Solution

We will build an intelligent agent that integrates with Jira to handle common tasks. The agent will be capable of understanding user requests, interacting with Jira on their behalf, and proactively handling events.

## 3. Key Features

The initial version of the agent will focus on the following core features:

*   **Automated Task Creation:** The agent will be able to create Jira issues (bugs, stories, tasks) based on natural language requests from users. It will be designed to identify necessary details like the project key, issue type, summary, and description. If any information is missing, the agent will intelligently ask clarifying questions to gather the required details before proceeding.
*   **Issue Summarization:** The agent will provide concise summaries of Jira issues upon request. This summary will include key information such as the issue's title, a summary of the description, its current status, and the assignee.
*   **Webhook-Based Automation:** The agent will be able to listen for Jira webhook events. For instance, upon a `jira:issue_created` event, it will automatically fetch the new issue's details and provide a summary, enabling better awareness of new tasks.

## 4. Proposed Architecture

The system will be composed of three main components:

1.  **Core Agent Logic (ADK):** The agent itself will be built using Google's Agent Development Kit (ADK), an open-source Python toolkit. The ADK will manage the agent's core logic, its operational instructions, and its interaction with a Large Language Model (LLM) like Gemini.
2.  **Jira Interaction Layer (MCP Server):** To interact with Jira, the agent will not connect to the Jira API directly. Instead, it will use a dedicated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server (`sooperset/mcp-atlassian`). This server will act as a secure bridge, providing the agent with a standardized set of tools (e.g., `jira_create_issue`, `jira_get_issue`) to perform actions in Jira. This approach abstracts away the complexities of direct API interaction and authentication.
3.  **Large Language Model (LLM):** The agent's intelligence and natural language capabilities will be powered by an LLM. The LLM will interpret user requests and follow a predefined set of instructions to determine the correct course of action.

```

## 5. Agent Persona

To ensure a consistent and positive user experience, the agent will adopt the following persona:

*   **Personality:** Helpful, efficient, professional, and slightly technical.
*   **Communication Style:** It will communicate concisely and clearly, using standard Jira terminology where appropriate to maintain a professional context.
